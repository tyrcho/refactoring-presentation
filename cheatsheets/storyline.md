#Presentation Storyline

There is a bug in production!

Our really important batch which processes numbers and translates them in various formats is failing for numbers greater than 400!

The source code of that batch has been written months ago and completed from time to time by various developers... Everybody added their own little touch to it!

You're given the responsibility of fixing the bug, and since you're a good developer, you decided to do it properly, by refactoring the code so the next developer will be happy to find some readable source code!

Your personal goals are: to refactor just enough in order to understand the root cause of the bug, then to fix the bug, and finally, to cleanup the code just enough for the next developer to be happy... Without falling in the trap of a too long refactoring!

Let's go!
