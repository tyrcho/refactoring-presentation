    #Why should you refactor?

    ---

    #1. Your code sucks.

    ---

    #2. Debts accrue interests.

    ---

    #3. Repetition is dangerous.

    ---

    #4. Spaghetti is good to eat, bad to read.

    ---

    #5. Littering is rude.

    #How should I refactor?

    ---

    #1. Safely. With tests.

    ---

    #2. Iteratively. With baby steps.

    ---

    #3. Assisted. With tools.

    ---

    #4. Smartly. With your brain.

    ---

    #5. Shared. With pair and reviews.
